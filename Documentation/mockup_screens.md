We will need wireframes or mock-ups that will guide us in the actual app development. A wireframe is a schematic, a blueprint, useful to help you and your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.

Here are the screens that I think we will need:

Login / Registration Screen: This is where users will be able to log into the application or create a new account.

Home Screen / Dashboard: After logging in, this is the first screen users will see. It could display a summary of the latest recipes and maybe some high-level statistics.

Recipe List Screen: This screen will list all of the recipes that the user has created. It might have options to filter or sort the recipes.

Recipe Detail Screen: When a user selects a recipe from the list, this screen will display all the details about that recipe. It could have an option to edit the recipe.

Add/Edit Recipe Screen: This is where a user will add a new recipe or edit an existing one. It will need fields for all of the recipe's properties.

Ingredient Lookup Screen: Here, users can search the ingredient database and add ingredients to a recipe.

Settings Screen: Here users can set the nutritionist's parameters, adjust account settings, and possibly export their data.

You can sketch these out on paper or use a wireframe tool. There are many free ones available, such as Balsamiq, Figma, Sketch, or even PowerPoint/Google Slides. These don't have to be perfectâ€”it's just about getting an idea of what information needs to be on each screen and how a user will navigate between them.

Once you have these sketches, you can also start to think about the design - colors, fonts, etc. But it's more important to get the functionality and flow right first.
