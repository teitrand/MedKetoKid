It seems like you're having a bunch of TypeScript issues, mainly around the Remix v2 migration.

Here are some solutions to the errors you've encountered:

Error: '\"@remix-run/react\"' has no exported member named 'MetaFunction'. Did you mean 'V2_MetaFunction'?

In Remix v2, MetaFunction has been renamed to V2_MetaFunction. So you should replace all instances of MetaFunction with V2_MetaFunction in your code.
Error: Type '() => { title: string; description: string; }' is not assignable to type 'V2_ServerRuntimeMetaFunction<unknown, {}>'.

The meta function needs to return V2_ServerRuntimeMetaDescriptor[] in Remix v2. It seems you're trying to return a plain object instead. You should revise your code to return the correct type.
Error: "Cannot find module '../config/ketogenicsConfig' or its corresponding type declarations."

This indicates that the module '../config/ketogenicsConfig' cannot be found. Ensure the path to this module is correct, and it's properly exported and typed.
Error: "Module '\"@remix-run/react\"' has no exported member 'useRouteData'.

It seems useRouteData doesn't exist in Remix v2. You should revise your usage according to the new API.
Error: "Cannot find name 'useState'."

You seem to be missing import for useState. Ensure that you import it from React like so: import React, { useState } from 'react'
Error: "Parameter 'event' implicitly has an 'any' type."

In TypeScript, you need to provide type for event. This could be any valid event type based on your usage, like React.MouseEvent, React.ChangeEvent etc.
