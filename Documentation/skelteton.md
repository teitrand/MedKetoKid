Let's create the skeleton
ChatGPT
Sure! Let's start with creating the basic skeleton of your app. Here's a suggested directory structure and a brief description of what each file could contain.

public - This folder will contain all the public-facing files like HTML, CSS, JS, and images.

public/css - Contains all the CSS stylesheets.

public/js - Contains all the JavaScript files.

public/img - Contains all the image files.

src - Contains all the source code.

src/components - Contains all the React components. Each screen in the app will be represented by one React component.

src/components/Home.tsx
src/components/RegistrationLogin.tsx
src/components/Dashboard.tsx
src/components/RecipeList.tsx
src/components/RecipeDetail.tsx
src/components/AddEditRecipe.tsx
src/components/IngredientLookup.tsx
src/components/Settings.tsx
src/routes - Contains the routing logic.

src/services - Contains services for business logic, like fetching data from API, or performing calculations.

src/data - Contains data or data models. You might not need this folder if you decide to fetch all data from an API.

src/utils - Contains utility functions, constants, and other miscellaneous code.

index.tsx - This is the entry point of your app.

This structure gives you a solid foundation to build upon. It separates concerns so that each part of your code has a single responsibility, making it easier to maintain and debug.

Remember that the structure can be changed and should evolve according to the needs of your project. It's just a starting point to help you organize your code better.

Is this a recommended skelteton structure for a Remix app project?
ChatGPT
Remix takes a different approach from other popular frameworks like Create React App. It places a lot of emphasis on file-based routing. That is, your directory structure in a Remix app also dictates your application's routing structure.

The main directories in a Remix app are usually:

app: This is the directory that contains all of your application code. The layout, routes, components, hooks, and utilities all go in here.

app/routes: The route components for each page in your application. Each file in this directory becomes a route based on its filename and location.

app/layouts: Layout components that are shared across multiple routes.

app/components: Reusable components that can be shared across multiple layouts or routes.

app/hooks: Custom hooks for shared logic.

public: This is where your static files live. Things like images, fonts, or static CSS would go in here.

remix.config.js: The configuration file for your Remix app.

package.json: Your standard npm package.json file.

If you'd like to add a directory for services or data models like I mentioned earlier, you can add them directly under the app directory. For instance, app/services could contain service logic and app/data could contain data models.

The structure is flexible and should be tailored to the needs of your specific application. It's designed to be intuitive and to reflect the structure of your application in the way you navigate through your file system.

Let's do it the right way right away. Give me the structure you know is best for making a app for android/ios and web with remix and remix server and typescript

# Skeleton
Here's a suggested directory structure based on the way a typical Remix app might be organized, keeping in mind that the app should be compatible with Android, iOS, and web:
```
arduino
Copy code
MedKetoKid
├── node_modules
├── public
│   ├── css
│   ├── img
│   ├── favicon.png
│   └── robots.txt
├── app
│   ├── routes
│   │   ├── index.tsx
│   │   ├── login.tsx
│   │   ├── register.tsx
│   │   ├── dashboard.tsx
│   │   ├── recipeList.tsx
│   │   ├── recipeDetail.tsx
│   │   ├── addEditRecipe.tsx
│   │   ├── ingredientLookup.tsx
│   │   └── settings.tsx
│   ├── components
│   ├── layouts
│   ├── services
│   ├── hooks
│   └── utils
├── remix.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
App Directory
```
routes: Contains the route components for each page in your application.
components: Contains reusable components used in multiple routes.
layouts: Contains layout components that wrap around multiple routes.
services: Contains functions to manage interactions with APIs or other backend services.
hooks: Contains React Hooks for shared state or logic.
utils: Contains utility functions and constants.
This structure would allow you to organize your project according to Remix's recommended practices while also ensuring it's well-organized for the specific needs of your app.

Remember to install the @types/react and @types/node packages for TypeScript definitions for React and Node.js, respectively. Use the command npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/node.

The "MedKetoKid" folder at the root is just a placeholder. Replace it with whatever directory you've created for your project. The node_modules directory is automatically created when you install Node.js packages, and the package.json and remix.config.js files will be generated by the Remix setup process.

# File structure 18.05.2021
Yes, the directory structure you posted is typical for a Remix project. Here's a brief overview of what each directory and file typically contains:

.cache: This folder is usually generated by some build tools or packages to improve the performance of subsequent builds. For instance, webpack or babel could store some compiled or transpiled files here.

app: This is the main directory where the application's React components, routes, hooks, and other functionalities live.

components: Where you store reusable components.

hooks: Where you store reusable React hooks.

layouts: This directory could contain your layout components that wrap around specific routes.

routes: Here's where you'd place your route components. Each file in this directory corresponds to a route in your application.

services: You could store your API calls or other services here.

utils: Any utility functions can go in this directory.

entry.client.tsx & entry.server.tsx: The entry points for your client and server bundles.

root.tsx: The root component that wraps around your application.

build: This folder typically contains the compiled output of your application after running a build command.

public: This is where you'd put static files that can be served directly by the server, such as images, CSS files, or the client-side JavaScript bundle.

node_modules: This folder is created by npm or yarn and contains all the dependencies for your project.

package.json & package-lock.json: These files manage dependencies for your project. The package-lock.json file also ensures consistent installs.

.gitignore: This file tells git which files or directories to ignore in your project.

.eslintrc.js: This file configures rules for ESLint, a popular linter for JavaScript.

remix.config.js: This is the configuration file for the Remix application.

tsconfig.json: This file provides project-level settings for TypeScript compiler options.

remix.env.d.ts: A TypeScript definition file for environment variables in your Remix project.

Do note that this is a standard structure and based on the common convention. Depending on the needs of your project, you may have more or fewer directories or files. Always structure your project in a way that makes the most sense for you and your team.
