Fantastic! Your Remix server is up and running. Now you can start developing your MedKetoKid app.

Here are the next steps:

Open your project folder (MedKetoKid) in your favorite code editor (PHPStorm or VSCode as you mentioned).

Your main entry point will be app/routes/index.tsx file. This is your home page.

To add a new route, simply create a new .tsx file inside the app/routes folder. The name of the file will be the URL of the new route. For example, creating app/routes/about.tsx will create a new route at http://localhost:3000/about.

To use data from your API, you'll want to look at the loaders in Remix. A loader is a function that runs on the server before your component is rendered. This is where you'd fetch the data you need for your component.

Make sure to check out the Remix documentation. It's very comprehensive and will be a big help as you build your application.

Remember, TypeScript is just JavaScript with types. So start coding as you would in JavaScript and add types as needed. Don't hesitate to ask if you need help with TypeScript or Remix. Happy coding!
