Let's move onto setting up some basic routes for your application. In a Remix application, routes are represented as files and folders in the `app` directory. Each file represents a single route, and the default export from each file is the component that will be rendered when that route is matched. 

Here are the steps to create a basic homepage and a page to display the details of a medical keto diet:

1. In your `app` directory, create a `routes` folder.

2. Inside the `routes` directory, create a `index.tsx` file. This will be your homepage.

3. Paste the following code into the `index.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome to MedKetoKid</h2>
      <p>
        <Link to="/keto-details">View Keto Diet Details</Link>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

4. Also in the `routes` directory, create a `keto-details.tsx` file. This will be the page for displaying details of a medical keto diet.

5. Paste the following code into the `keto-details.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function KetoDetailsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Keto Diet Details</h2>
      <p>This is a page where we will provide details about a medical keto diet.</p>
      <p>
        <Link to="/">Back to Home</Link>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now you should have a basic functioning web application with two routes. You can run your application with `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your homepage. Clicking on the "View Keto Diet Details" link will take you to the Keto Diet Details page.
