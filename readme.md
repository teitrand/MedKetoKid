## Features

Absolutely, starting with the core functionalities first and then expanding with new features in later versions is a smart approach. Here's the final outline for the MedKetoKid app version 1:

**App Name**: MedKetoKid

**Platform**: iOS and Android

**Features**:

1. **User Profile**: Create a profile for your son, including age, weight, dietary restrictions, and preferences. Support for multiple caregivers to manage the same profile.

4. **Unified Recipe Builder & Nutritional Guidelines**: In one interface, caregivers can create custom recipes and see how the nutritional values of the recipe match up with the desired nutritional guidelines. The recipe builder allows input of food quantities in grams with 0.1-gram resolution.

5. **Auto-Calculate Function**: Automatically calculate and adjust the amount of each ingredient to match the desired nutritional values. Each ingredient line can be locked to prevent the auto-calculate feature from changing its quantity.

10. **Professional Connect**: Share your son's meal plan, progress, and nutrient intake with your nutritionist for review and feedback. This feature allows you to enter the nutritionist's details, compile relevant data into reports, and send them directly to the nutritionist's email.

11. **Notifications and Reminders**: Get reminders for meal preparations, shopping for groceries, and scheduled check-ups with your nutritionist.

12. **Backup and Sync**: Ensure data is backed up and synced across devices to prevent loss of data and provide a consistent experience across multiple devices.

As always, remember that the ketogenic diet is a medical diet and should always be managed under professional supervision. It should be adjusted based on your son's needs and the professional's advice. While the app aims to simplify and streamline the management of the diet, it is not intended to replace professional medical advice or supervision.
